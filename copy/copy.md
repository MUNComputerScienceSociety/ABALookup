- What?
    - The ABA Lookup tool is designed to facilitate the process of matching Applied Behaviour Analysis (ABA) therapists with parents of children diagnosed with Autism Spectrum disorder (ASD). This tool supplies parents with the ability to search a database of available therapists, view availability schedules, and initialize contact with therapists. ABA Lookup not only helps parents search for therapists, but also to assist therapists in advertising their practice, allowing them to post their weekly availability schedules.
- What?
    - The ABA Lookup tool is designed to facilitate the process of matching Applied Behaviour Analysis (ABA) therapists with parents of children with Autism Spectrum disorder (ASD). This tool allows parents to quickly and easily search through available therapists and view their schedule to contact and acquire a therapist more quickly and easily. ABA Lookup not only helps parents search for therapists, but also to assist therapists in acquiring a family much more quickly than the conventional way of posting advertisements around town. This tool allows you to post your weekly schedule of availability for parents to see, thus greatly improving the opportunity to find work.
- Why develop the lookup?
    - When it comes to finding an ABA therapist in guiding the development of your child, parents/guardians often encounter great difficulty in finding and/or acquiring a therapist within a reasonable amount of time. That time can be further lengthened by the possibility of incompatibility between the child and therapist, but also the possible inconvenient scheduling times with a party. On the other hand, therapists can encounter difficulty in finding a family just as well and easily as parents can in finding a therapist for their child. This matching tool, we hope, will drastically decrease the time and effort necessary for the typical process in searching for the other party by means of written, typed or scattered electronic advertisements by providing a single website where either party can go and simply perform an online search for the other party.

    - When it comes to finding an ABA therapist in guiding the development of your child, parents/guardians often encounter great difficulty acquiring a therapist. That time can be further lengthened by the possible incompatibility between the child and therapist or inconvenient scheduling times with a party. Previously, this would require parents to start from "square one" via cumbersome paperwork or scattered electronic advertisements. By providing a single website to centralize this process, we aim to drastically decrease the time and effort necessary for typical patient therapist matching.

- Parents
    - As a parent/guardian, you can create a custom schedule to indicate which days/hours of the week you are available for  therapy sessions. The ABA lookup tool will then match you with a therapist according to how well your schedules mesh. You can choose to contact a therapist (or as many as you desire), through our service. After this initial introduction all further contact with your therapist should be conducted outside of this site.
- Therapists
    - As an ABA therapist, you can create a schedule denoting your hours of availability as well as your location. Based on the compatibility of your schedules, you will be matched up with patients. You will be notified through email when parents express interest in your services. After this initial introduction, subsequent communication is to be conducted outside of this website.

With current efforts to match ABA therapists and parents being scattered, ABA Lookup aims to focus these efforts into one easy-to-use online tool. Instead of using job advertisements, bulletin boards, or word of mouth, users of ABA Lookup will be able to use one central resource to find the therapist that works for them in a fraction of the time that was previously required, and at no cost. If you think this service could help you or your family, or to find out more please click on the "Learn More" link above.

The problem in finding a therapist or family is often threefold:

1. Finding a therapist or family is a challenge in itself.
2. Successfully finding a therapist or family only to realize that the schedules don't match, resulting in repeating the entire process.
3. Finding out if the therapist and the child requiring therapy are a good match.

ABA Lookup eliminates the first two problems. By providing one central location for both therapists and parents to find each other, it saves time and energy resulting in a child with ASD receiving the therapy they need as soon as possible.
After entering their schedule and any other criteria (e.g. location, whether the child prefers male or female therapists, etc.), the search finds a match based on your personal needs. The first result in the list is designated as the best match for you according to the input you provided. In doing this we eliminate both the first and second problems, namely locating a therapist and matching the schedule of both the therapist and the parents. With two thirds of the problem taken care of, all that is left is to introduce both the therapist and the child.  At this point we hope that you have successfully found your therapist. If not, it is only a matter of contacting the second result on your list, thus saving you from having to start from "square one".

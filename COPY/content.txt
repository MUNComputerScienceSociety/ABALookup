(Learn more->About):
(What?)  The ABA Lookup tool is designed to facilitate the process of matching ABA therapists with parents of children
diagnosed with Autism Spectrum disorder (ASD). This tool supplies parents with the ability to search a database of 
available therapists, view availability schedules, and initialize contact with therapists. ABA Lookup not only helps 
parents search for therapists, but also to assist therapists in advertising their practice, allowing them to post their
weekly availability schedules.
(Why develop the lookup?)	When it comes to finding an Applied Behaviour Analysis (ABA) therapist in guiding the 
development of your child, parents/guardians often encounter great difficulty acquiring a therapist. That time can be 
further lengthened by the possible incompatibility between the child and therapist or  inconvenient scheduling times 
with a party. Previously,   this would require parents to start from square one via cumbersome paperwork or  scattered 
electronic advertisements.  By providing a single website to centralize this process, we aim to drastically decrease 
the time and effort necessary for typical patient therapist matching, 
----------------------------------	
(Post-landing page/sign up page):
(Parents)	As a parent/guardian, you can create  a custom schedule to indicate which days/hours of the week you are 
available for  therapy sessions. The ABA lookup tool will then match you with a therapist according to how well your 
schedules mesh. You can choose to contact a therapist (or as many as you desire), through our service. After this 
initial introduction all further contact with your therapist should be conducted outside of this site. 
(Therapists)	As an ABA therapist, you can create a schedule denoting your hours of availability as well as your 
location. Based on the compatibility of your schedules, you will be matched up with patients. You will be notified 
through email when parents express interest in your services.  After this initial introduction, subsequent 
communication is to be conducted outside of this website.
--------------------------------
(Searching page - Parents)	Search for therapists in your area. You will be matched according to the compatibility of 
your schedules. From there you may decide to contact that person or to keep looking.

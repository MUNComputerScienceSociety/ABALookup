Contributing to ABA Lookup
==========================

We are trying to streamline the process of matching ABA therapists with parents of children with Autism.

**Here's how you can help.**

Accessibility
-------------

Making the application accessible is a priority.

Try using the application with a screen reader or navigating around the application with the keyboard, how is that experience? Is the copy too wordy? Do the colours contrast enough? Please open issues to let us know what can be improved.

Reporting issues
----------------

[You can see the list of current issues here.](https://github.com/MUNComputerScienceSociety/ABALookup/issues) You can open a new issue by clicking "New Issue".

Issues can really be anything - bugs, enhancements, questions, tweaks, etc, but please keep them localised to one thing. Open multiple issues for multiple things.

Before opening a new issue, check to see if the issue you going to open has already been filed: don't be put off by a closed issue, we can reopen them if need be.

Contributing to ABA Lookup
==========================

We are trying to streamline the process of matching ABA therapists with parents of children with Autism. **Here's how you can help.**

Accessibility
-------------

Making the application accessible is a priority.

Try using the application with a screen reader, or navigating around the application with the keyboard and point out what could be made better. Please file issues using the accessibility label.

Reporting issues
----------------

[You can see the list of current issues here.](https://github.com/MUNComputerScienceSociety/ABALookup/issues) You can open a new issue by clicking "New Issue".

Issues can really be anything - bugs, enhancements, questions, tweaks, etc.

Please file one ticket per issue. You can label issues with one of the predefined labels created - label browser specific issues with one of the browser labels (Firefox, Chromium, MSIE, Webkit, etc).

Before opening a new issue, check to see if the issue you going to open has already been filed - comment on a closed issue to have it reopened.

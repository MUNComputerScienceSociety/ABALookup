Contributing to ABA Lookup
==========================

We are trying to streamline the process of matching ABA therapists with parents

Reporting issues
----------------

Issues can really be anything - bugs, enhancements, questions, tweaks, etc.

Please file one ticket per issue. You can label issues with one of the
predefined labels created -- label browser specific issues with one of the
browser labels (Firefox, MSIE, Webkit, etc).

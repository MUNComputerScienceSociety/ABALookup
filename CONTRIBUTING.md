Contributing to ABA Lookup
==========================

We are trying to streamline the process of matching ABA therapists with parents of children with Autism.

**Here's how you can help.**

Please take a moment to review this document in order to make the contribution process easy and effective for everyone involved.

Following these guidelines helps to communicate that you respect the time of the developers managing and developing this open source project. In return, they should reciprocate that respect in addressing your issue or assessing patches and features.

Accessibility
-------------

Making the application accessible is a priority.

Try using the application with a screen reader or navigating around the application with the keyboard, how is that experience? Is the copy too wordy? Do the colours contrast enough? Please open issues to let us know what can be improved.

Reporting issues
----------------

Pedantry: please try to keep issue titles terse and use [sentence casing].

[You can see the list of current issues here.](https://github.com/MUNComputerScienceSociety/ABALookup/issues) You can open a new issue by clicking "New Issue".

Issues can really be anything - bugs, enhancements, questions, tweaks, etc, but please keep them localised to one thing. Open multiple issues for multiple things.

Before opening a new issue, check to see if the issue you going to open has already been filed: don't be put off by a closed issue, we can reopen them if need be.

Coding standards
----------------

The accepted style and conventions are dependent on the language"

**JS**:

To run JSHint against JavaScript files:

    grunt lint

**PHP**:

This project _tries_ to adhere to the [Zend Framework Coding Standard for PHP] with the following modifications:

- Indentation should consist of **tab characters**, and spaces are to be used for formatting/alignment
- All files should end with a trailing newline (LF)
- PHP constants should be uppercased (including `TRUE`, `FALSE`, and `NULL`)

Also, try to keep Git commit messages terse - if they are getting truncated by GitHub, that's not a good sign.
